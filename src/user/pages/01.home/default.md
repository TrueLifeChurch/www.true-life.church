## An Apestolical Church of Jesus Christ

#### Our Statment of Faith

We belive in the Bible standard of full salation, which is repentance, baptism in water by immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, the baptism of the Holly Gost with the initial sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance, and living a godly life of holiness.
